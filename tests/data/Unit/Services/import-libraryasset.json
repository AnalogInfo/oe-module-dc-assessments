            "content": "<p>It’s a common thinking pattern for many people to categorize events, people, and situations in a polarized or good/bad sort of way.&nbsp; Unfortunately that can often lead to missing many of the shades of gray, or in between aspects.&nbsp;&nbsp; This black or white way of thinking most often distorts the reality of an event, person, or situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few things in life are all or nothing, always, or never.</p><p>The purpose of this task is to monitor how often you might use one or another of the common polarized ways of thinking, and then change that thought (or even verbal speech) to a more realistic word.&nbsp; For example: if you hear yourself say “I never get appreciated for ….” Pause and consider if that’s really true.&nbsp; Never means NEVER.&nbsp; Even one instance where you were shown appreciation, even a little bit, means that ‘never’ is not correct.&nbsp; Change your internal thought or external speech to, “I rarely get appreciated for …” or it may be more correct to say, “I don’t get appreciated as much as I’d like.”&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Your objective in this task is to observe for the Polarizing Key Words (the most common ones are listed below) in your thoughts or in your conversations.&nbsp; Each time you notice a Polarizing Key Word catch the thought or in conversation and correct it with a modifier. If you identify more Polarized Key Words add them to the list.</p><p>All&nbsp;<br> Nothing&nbsp;<br> Everything<br> &nbsp;<br> Always&nbsp;<br> Never&nbsp;<br> None&nbsp;<br> Completely<br> Entirely&nbsp;<br> Nobody&nbsp;<br> Whole (day, event)</p><p>Modifier words: Most; Few; Many; Frequently; Seldom; Hardly any; Mostly; Largely;<br> &nbsp;</p>",
